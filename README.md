# Modification of the Celeba Dataset of faces of celebrities

You can check out the dataset at : **https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pMnLoJgS9k-vg6YOsxgx-QTNYw5as1wD?usp=sharing**

The dataset can be used for mask detection, identification and also for image/instance segmentation after slight modification.

Was built with the help of the [MaskTheFace][https://github.com/aqeelanwar/MaskTheFace] masked face generator.

**Task :** Create a unique dataset that can be used to solve a real world problem.

## Data

The data is a small fraction of the original Celeba Dataset that can be found [here][https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html]

## List of all major libraries utilised in the application:

1. OpenCV
2. Dlib


## Highlights

  - Completely new dataset with support for multiple mask types for the Covid-19 mask detection and segmentation.
  - Will be adding support for instance segmentation with black inpainted region in place of the mask.
